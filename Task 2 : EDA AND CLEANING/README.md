# EDA AND CLEANING:
### Sub-Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
1. **Data Types and Statistics:** 📈
   - Check data types of each column (numeric, categorical, datetime).
   - Compute summary statistics like mean, median, min, max, standard deviation.

2. **Variable Distributions:** 📉
   - Visualize distributions of numeric variables (histograms, box plots).
   - Explore categorical variables through bar charts or counts.

### Sub-Task 2: Price Sensitivity and Churn Correlation 💰🔄
1. **Define Price Sensitivity:** 📉💵
   - Create a metric or index representing price sensitivity.
   - Analyze changes in consumption patterns based on price fluctuations.

2. **Correlation with Churn:** 📊🔄
   - Calculate correlations between price sensitivity and churn.
   - Visualize relationships between price sensitivity and churn status.

### Sub-Task 3: Key Findings Summary and Data Suggestions 📝🔍
1. **Summary of Key Findings:** 📌🔍
   - Condense essential insights from the analysis.
   - Highlight significant trends or anomalies discovered.

2. **Suggestions for Data Augmentation:** 📈🔍
   - Identify gaps for additional data that could enhance predictive power.
   - Propose potential external data sources to complement the dataset.

### Overall Problem: 🎯
The goal is to explore the dataset comprehensively, study the relationship between price sensitivity and churn, and summarize key insights while recommending additional data sources to boost churn prediction models. 🚀
